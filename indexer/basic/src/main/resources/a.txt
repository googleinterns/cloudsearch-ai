Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) —
United States, February 12–March 16, 2020
CDC COVID-19 Response Team
Globally, approximately 170,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an
estimated 7,000 deaths in approximately 150 countries (1).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China
have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe
COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger
persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19
cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths
occurred among adults aged ≥60 years; only one (0.1%)
death occurred in a person aged ≤19 years (3). In this report,
COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during
February 12–March 16, 2020 and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death)
were analyzed by age group. As of March 16, a total of 4,226
COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to
CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living
in long-term care facilities (4). Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of
hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths
associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged ≥65 years
with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons
aged ≥85 years. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were
reported among persons aged ≤19 years. Similar to reports from
other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious
disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups.
Data from cases reported from 49 states, the District of
Columbia, and three U.S. territories (5) to CDC during
February 12–March 16 were analyzed. Cases among persons
repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and from
Japan (including patients repatriated from cruise ships) were
excluded. States and jurisdictions voluntarily reported data on
laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 using previously
developed data collection forms (6). The cases described in this
report include both COVID-19 cases confirmed by state or
local public health laboratories as well as those with a positive
test at the state or local public health laboratories and confirmation at CDC. No data on serious underlying health conditions
were available. Data on these cases are preliminary and are missing for some key characteristics of interest, including hospitalization status (1,514), ICU admission (2,253), death (2,001),
and age (386). Because of these missing data, the percentages
of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths (case-fatality
percentages) were estimated as a range. The lower bound of
these percentages was estimated by using all cases within each
age group as denominators. The corresponding upper bound
of these percentages was estimated by using only cases with
known information on each outcome as denominators.
As of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases had been
reported in the United States, with reports increasing to 500
or more cases per day beginning March 14 (Figure 1). Among
2,449 patients with known age, 6% were aged ≥85, 25%
were aged 65–84 years, 18% each were aged 55–64 years and
45–54 years, and 29% were aged 20–44 years (Figure 2). Only
5% of cases occurred in persons aged 0–19 years.
Among 508 (12%) patients known to have been hospitalized,
9% were aged ≥85 years, 36% were aged 65–84 years, 17%
were aged 55–64 years, 18% were 45–54 years, and 20% were
aged 20–44 years. Less than 1% of hospitalizations were among
persons aged ≤19 years (Figure 2). The percentage of persons
hospitalized increased with age, from 2%–3% among persons
aged ≤9 years, to ≥31% among adults aged ≥85 years. (Table).
Among 121 patients known to have been admitted to an
ICU, 7% of cases were reported among adults ≥85 years,
46% among adults aged 65–84 years, 36% among adults
aged 45–64 years, and 12% among adults aged 20–44 years
(Figure 2). No ICU admissions were reported among persons

aged ≤19 years. Percentages of ICU admissions were lowest
among adults aged 20–44 years (2%–4%) and highest among
adults aged 75–84 years (11%–31%) (Table).
Among 44 cases with known outcome, 15 (34%) deaths
were reported among adults aged ≥85 years, 20 (46%) among
adults aged 65–84 years, and nine (20%) among adults aged
20–64 years. Case-fatality percentages increased with increasing
age, from no deaths reported among persons aged ≤19 years to
highest percentages (10%–27%) among adults aged ≥85 years
(Table) (Figure 2).
Discussion
Since February 12, 4,226 COVID-19 cases were reported in
the United States; 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53%
of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults
aged ≥65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes
among persons aged ≥85 years. These findings are similar to
data from China, which indicated >80% of deaths occurred
among persons aged ≥60 years (3). These preliminary data
also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization,
including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of
any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged ≤19 years
appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no
hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United
States in this age group. Given the spread of COVID-19 in
many U.S. communities, CDC continues to update current
recommendations and develop new resources and guidance,
including for adults aged ≥65 years as well as those involved
in their care (7,8).
Approximately 49 million U.S. persons are aged ≥65 years
(9), and many of these adults, who are at risk for severe
COVID-19–associated illness, might depend on services and
support to maintain their health and independence. To prepare
for potential COVID-19 illness among persons at high risk,
family members and caregivers of older adults should know what
medications they are taking and ensure that food and required
medical supplies are available. Long-term care facilities should
be particularly vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread
of COVID-19 (10). In addition, clinicians who care for adults
should be aware that COVID-19 can result in severe disease
among persons of all ages. Persons with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms and call their provider for guidance if symptoms worsen or seek emergency care
for persistent severe symptoms. Additional guidance is available

This report describes the current epidemiology of
COVID-19 in the United States, using preliminary data. The
findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations.
First, data were missing for key variables of interest. Data on
age and outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission,
and death, were missing for 9%–53% of cases, which likely
resulted in an underestimation of these outcomes. Second,
further time for follow-up is needed to ascertain outcomes
among active cases. Third, the initial approach to testing was
to identify patients among those with travel histories or persons
with more severe disease, and these data might overestimate
the prevalence of severe disease. Fourth, data on other risk
factors, including serious underlying health conditions that
could increase risk for complications and severe illness, were
unavailable at the time of this analysis. Finally, limited testing
to date underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance of
COVID-19 cases. Additional investigation will increase the
understanding about persons who are at risk for severe illness
and death from COVID-19 and inform clinical guidance and
community-based mitigation measures.*

The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases
among persons in the United States increases with age. Social
distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of
the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect
vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain
adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day
supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space
between themselves and others, stay away from those who are
sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Early data from China suggest that a majority of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have occurred among adults
aged ≥60 years and among persons with serious underlying
health conditions.
What is added by this report?
This first preliminary description of outcomes among patients
with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that fatality was
highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%,
followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65–84 years, 1% to
3% among persons aged 55-64 years, <1% among persons aged
20–54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged ≤19 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
COVID-19 can result in severe disease, including hospitalization,
admission to an intensive care unit, and death, especially
among older adults. Everyone can take actions, such as social
distancing, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect
older adults from severe illness.
nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to
further reduce the risk of being exposed (7). Persons of all ages
and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of
COVID-19 and protect older adults.†
